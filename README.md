# manjaro sway edition

## description

i recently saw, that there was a decent manjaro sway distribution for arm. this is my approach to port a lot from those configurations to a regular manjaro sway built, with some smaller and bigger changes:

- trying to use a decent cli solution whenever available
- pre-package some tools for software development
- automate stuff where feasible

## what doesn't work yet?

you tell me. that is what issues are for.

## sources

- [iso profile](https://github.com/boredland/manjaro-iso-profiles/tree/main/community/sway)
- [desktop settings](https://github.com/boredland/arch-repo/tree/master/custom/manjaro-sway-settings)

## building

1. check out the iso profile
2. `buildiso -p sway`
